# ACM

This file is in a submodule because the certificate has to live in us-east-1 according to the AWS docs here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/cnames-and-https-requirements.html#https-requirements-certificate-issuer

DNS is also managed here with the porkbun terraform provider.
